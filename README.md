I believe web development can change lives â€” and I want to change mine.  
HackYourFuture is more than just a course for me, it's a dream.  
Iâ€™m 100% committed, focused, and ready to work hard to become a developer.

I'm not afraid to fail, Iâ€™m afraid of *not trying*.  
I want to be part of a strong community that supports each other, and Iâ€™m always ready to help others too.
